            <h3>Product Queue</h3>
            <p>
              Product Queue was my first UI/UX project assignment for Lambda
              School. I was one of a three student team tasked with building a
              responsive landing page, with HTML, CSS and Javascript. We were
              given a name and a small description of what the company might do.
              My code and design was ultimately chosen to present as the final
              product.

            <h3>Bookr</h3>
            <p>
              Bookr is a website where you can review and rate books. Users can
              write a review of the book and give it 1 to 5 stars. I worked with
              a team of 3 other developers to develop this site from the ground
              up. I primarily worked in the front-end with React, Redux, Axios
              and JavaScript. The back-end database was built with Sqlite, Knex
              and Express.
