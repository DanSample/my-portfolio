        <h2>The Past</h2>
        <p>My original creative outlet has always been music. When I was 12 years old, we moved away from the little beach town I grew up in, Copalis Beach WA. We moved into a city called Aberdeen WA. It is there I found my love for music. I found new friends who were into music, and started singing and playing guitar. I started a band with a few friends called Ninthhour, and I spent the next 5 years creating and performing music with them. By the time I turned 18 years old, we all wanted to go in different directions musically, so we decide to go our seperate ways. After that I heard through some friends that a band called Painted Soul was looking for a vocalist. I decided to try out, and it was a perfect fit. I spent the next 7 years creating, recording, performing, and touring the west coast and eastern parts of Washington with Painted Soul. Those were some of the best times of my life. All good things must come to an end though, family life for us all needed more attention then we could give it having fulltime jobs, families and the band. Something had to give and Painted Soul was that something. </p>

        <h2>The Present</h2>
        <p>In 2013 I became the luckiest man in the world, I asked the woman I loved and cherished more than anything in the world to marry me and she accepted. We moved into a house and started to build our lives together. I worked as a Telecom Technician and she as a supervisor for an Aerospace company. I had been growing dissatisfied in my work and wanted to find something that I could use my creativity In 2017 we recieved wonderful news that we were becoming parents. </p>
